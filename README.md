# Nicholas Lovera - Pokemon Battle Simulator

# Languages Used
- C++
- Lua (Soon to come)

# Summary
- This program simulates a Pokemon battle between the user and the computer. In the beginning the user chooses a Pokemon and is then forced to battle another Pokemon which is selected randomly by the computer. In later updates of this game, the user will be able to level up its Pokemon to evolve it, teach it new moves, open packs to obtain new Pokemon with varying rarities and eventually even beat the game by facing off againt a random Legendary Pokemon! So far this is just the baseline of the full game to come, but using Lua and C++, this game will fully come to frution to be a full game of battles against increasingly difficult Pokemon! This program uses a plethora of different coding techniques, such as has and is-a class relationships, the random function, loops, if statments, and function testing.

# Things To Come
- Machine Learning: Used so that the program can decide what attack can do the most damage depending on the element of the users Pokemon
- Graphics: So the user is not just looking at text the entire time, this program will eventually have graphics to get it an RPG like experience
- Virtual Currency Obtained Through Battles: After each battle, depending on how tough the opponent was, the user will gain currency to open packs, obtain new moves, new Pokemon, and even be able to add a foil to their Pokemon card!
- Marketplace: A market place will appear after each battle for the user to upgrade their deck and Pokemon before the next battle
